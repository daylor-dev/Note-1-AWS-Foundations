# ðŸ’» Note 1: AWS Foundations â”‚ Servers/ EC2 / SSH / RDK

To complement my studies, I created a diagram that represents how users (it can be a human being or another software) connects with the VPC.

## ðŸ˜— Key Concept: VPC 
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network within a public cloud (for example, AWS ðŸ™‚). The VPC contains computer resources that work for a specific reason (for a company or a person).

*Quick correction: on the diagram, Remote Desktop is RDP, not RDK*
